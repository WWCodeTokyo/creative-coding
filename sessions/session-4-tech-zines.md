# üìñ Session 4: Tech Zines

## 1. What are Zines?

Zines, short for "magazines" are simple booklets of imagery or comics and printed for distribution. The printing is often low-cost, swapping glossy magazine pages for black-and-white photocopy or inkjet printing. More art-grade Zines may be printed via silkscreen or [Risograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risograph).

Zines have roots in Punk Rock and Art culture, but recently have become a tool to teach about technology.

### Examples:

* [https://wizardzines.com/](https://wizardzines.com) Wizard Zines by Julia Evans

* [https://techzinefair.org/](https://techzinefair.org) New York Tech Zine Fair

Also, given our Network is based in Tokyo, we must nod to the influence of Manga in educational materials. Ai Minatogawa (ÊπäÂ∑ù „ÅÇ„ÅÑ) created the illustrations behind [a series of books on software and technology](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/%E6%B9%8A%E5%B7%9D-%E3%81%82%E3%81%84/e/B01N8OK2UW?ref\_=dbs\_p\_ebk\_r00\_abau\_000000).

## 3. Crafting

Now that you have your idea, how to you make it?

### Physical Resources

The most traditional way to make a zine is with REAL Materials. It's time for crafting. Don‚Äôt worry if you're not a skilled illustrator, it's normal for Zines to have a "raw" look, and you can mix and layer imagery from other sources.\*

#### Basic supplies:

* A4 white paper
* Anything that makes black marks: e.g. chunky markers like Sharpie, fine-tip pens like Sakura Micron, Brush Pens, Sumi ink, crayon... whatever you have on hand
* Scissors
* A magazine with imagery to cut and remix (Think tech magazines, TSUTAYA bookstores often have some great stuff)
* Glue (Ann recommends [„Ç¢„É©„ÉÉ„Éì„ÇØ„É§„Éû„Éà](https://www.yamato.co.jp/products/I00000042/) which can be found at any Japanese convenience store)
* Stapler for binding

If you're joining us from outside Japan, please adjust as necessary: US Letter for A4, glue stick, whatever writing tools are available.

#### Advanced supplies:

* ["Non-photo Blue" pencils](https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Non-Photo-Blue-Pencils-and-Pens/pt/339) that are invisible to photocopiers for initial sketches
* Tracing paper (or [make your own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsSRTcmnewM\&ab\_channel=thefrugalcrafterLindsayWeirich))
* [Correction tape](https://www.muji.com/jp/ja/store/cmdty/detail/4550344302477) for editing, or layering on white marks
* Washi tape
* Textural materials like decorative papers, half-tone patterns,

Go to [Seikaido](https://www.sekaido.co.jp) in Shinjuku and check out the Manga section if you really want to go deep üòç

#### Printing

Stop by your neighborhood Conbini and use the photocopier to make prints. Or scan, save as a PDF, and distribute digitally.

For those of you in Japan, we are lucky to have lots of retro tech like Risographs available to the community. You can also do silk-screen. As these techniques are more advanced, they are beyond the scope of our session, but we're just trying to give you an idea of the possibilities üòä

* Silk Screen developing and ink available at [Uematsu](https://e-uematsu.co.jp) in Shibuya
* Risograph: [Hand Saw Press](http://handsawpresstokyo.com) in Shinagawa

### Digital Resources

Prefer to work digitally? Here are our recommendations for digital Zine creation:

* Draw on a tablet like an iPad or Microsoft Surface
* Use [Canva.com](https://www.notion.so/wwcode/Zines-833f018194ac4ea0b70926a3d05172b6#732d41806c6a4d0390b7e3516ee31e56)'s free comic templates
