**Creative Coding to Inspire**

Creative Coding is an approach to programming that celebrates innovation, experimentations, humor, and learning from failure. It is not limited to front-end development, image creation, or a particular language. This session is for: 1. People who want to build portfolio projects, but need ideas 2. People who feel stuck in their career and miss when coding was \*fun\* 3. People who want to mix technology with other disciplines like Art, Culture, History, etc. Come explore and get inspired with several prompts for your next project. All levels welcome!
