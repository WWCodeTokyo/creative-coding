### Hardware

Mechanical keyboards are growing in popularity due to their customizability and quality. Be warned they are an investment, but if you'd like to learn more, check out the following links. (Links to businesses are provided for educational purposes and are not endorsements)

#### Switches

The mechanical part of the key that controls the raising and lowering is called a "switch." Different switches have different feels. Some are loud and clicky, while others are silent. Some are tactile, others are smooth. The following podcast gives a sense of how various keys perform:
