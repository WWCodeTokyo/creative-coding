### What are Emoji? :thinking:

While Internet users of the 90's sent one another emoticons like `;)` and :`D` from ASCII characters \[1], today's familiar icons were born out of a 1999 set by Japanese artist Shigetaka Kurita, who designed a set of 176 pictograms for NTT Docomo. The images were 12 x 12 pixels, designed for the early mobile phones and pagers \[2]. The name "emoji" comes from the Japanese e (çµµ), meaning picture, plus moji (æ–‡å­—), meaning character. Emoji use spread around the world from 2010 after mobile OS developers added them to their software \[3].\
