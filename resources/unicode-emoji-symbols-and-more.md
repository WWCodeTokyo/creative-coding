# ðŸ˜Š Unicode: Emoji, Symbols, and more

## What is Unicode?

[Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) is a technology standard for representing characters. It includes over 144,000 symbols from 159 different languages, as well as various symbols, emoji, and a few non-visual characters and formatting codes. The standard is managed by the nonprofit [Unicode Consortium](https://unicode.org/consortium/consort.html).\

This chapter focuses less on the technical implementation and more on resources for interesting symbols to use in your projects.

### Non-visual characters

What is a non-visual character? The idea seems fairly strange, but there are a few special characters which were useful in the earlier days of computing. One of these is the "bell character" which emits the sound of a bell ðŸ”” rather than printing a character to the screen.
