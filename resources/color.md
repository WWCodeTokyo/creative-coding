# 🌈 Color

## Color 🌈

Colors are a foundational element of any visual art. On computers, there are different ways of representing colors in code. The main models are:

#### [RGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB\_color\_model): Red 🔴 Green 🟢 Blue 🔵

This model is additive, meaning we are adding light-based colors.

#### [CMYK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK\_color\_model): Cyan 🚙 Magenta 💗 Yellow 🌞 blacK (or Key) 🐈‍⬛

This model is subtractive, meaning we are "taking away" light. It's popularized in the printing world, as using ink in these four color can generate a wide range of colors. Some software programs use CMYK

#### [HSB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL\_and\_HSV) Hue, Saturation, Brightness (sometimes Lightness or Value)

This model was created in the 1970s by computer graphics researchers to approximate the way the human eye sees color.

### Web Colors 🎨

Web colors use the RGB (red-green-blue) model and are represented as three bytes (six hexadecimal characters):

Byte 1: 🔴 Red 00-FF Byte 2: 🟢 Green 00-FF Byte 3: 🔵 Blue 00-FF
